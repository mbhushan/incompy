There are a large number of different approaches to machine learning, but all try
to learn a model that is a generalization of the provided examples. All have three
components:
• A representation of the model,
• An objective function for assessing the goodness of the model, and
• An optimization method for learning a model that minimizes or maximizes the value of the objective function.

In supervised learning, we start with a set of feature vector/label pairs. 127 The
goal is to derive from these examples a rule that predicts the label associated
with a previously unseen feature vector.

Supervised machine learning is broadly used in practice for such tasks as
detecting fraudulent use of credit cards and recommending movies to people.
The best algorithms are quite sophisticated, and understanding them requires a
level of mathematical sophistication


In unsupervised learning, we are given a set of feature vectors but no labels.
The goal of unsupervised learning is to uncover latent structure in the set of
feature vectors. For example, given the set of presidential feature vectors, an
unsupervised learning algorithm might separate the presidents into tall and
short, or perhaps into American and French.

The most popular unsupervised learning techniques are designed to find
clusters of similar feature vectors. Geneticists, for example, use clustering to
find groups of related genes. Many popular clustering methods are surprisingly
simple. We will present the most widely used algorithm later in this chapter.
