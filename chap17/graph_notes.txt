17.2.1 Some Classic Graph-Theoretic Problems
One of the nice things about formulating a problem using graph theory is that
there are well-known algorithms for solving many optimization problems on
graphs. Some of the best-known graph optimization problems are:
•
Shortest path. For some pair of nodes, N1 and N2 , find the shortest
sequence of edges <s , d > (source node and destination node), such that
o The source node in the first edge is N1
o The destination node of the last edge is N2
o For all edges e1 and e2 in the sequence, if e2 follows e1 in the
sequence, the source node of e2 is the destination node of e1 .

• Shortest weighted path. This is like the shortest path, except instead
of choosing the shortest sequence of edges that connects two nodes, we
define some function on the weights of the edges in the sequence (e.g.,
their sum) and minimize that value. This is the kind of problem solved
by Mapquest and Google Maps when asked to compute driving directions
between two points.
• Cliques. Find a set of nodes such that there is a path (or often a path
not exceeding a maximum length) in the graph between each pair of
nodes in the set. 115
• Min cut. Given two sets of nodes in a graph, a cut is a set of edges
whose removal eliminates all paths from each node in one set to each
node in the other. The minimum cut is the smallest set of edges whose
removal accomplishes this.
