Dynamic programming is a method for efficiently solving problems that exhibit
the characteristics of overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure.
Fortunately, many optimization problems exhibit these characteristics.

A problem has optimal substructure if a globally optimal solution can be found
by combining optimal solutions to local subproblems. Weâ€™ve already looked at a
number of such problems. Merge sort, for example, exploits the fact that a list
can be sorted by first sorting sublists and then merging the solutions.

A problem has overlapping subproblems if an optimal solution involves solving
the same problem multiple times. Merge sort does not exhibit this property.
Even though we are performing a merge many times, we are merging different
lists each time
